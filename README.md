# Weekie Mochi JWT API
Weekie Mochi is a 2chan-like app: It allows users to create posts, user profiles, comments and allows users to react to comments.<br>
This version of the API works with JSON WEB TOKEN's to handle sessions.

## Business Rules
- **Profiles**:
    - All User Profiles require a username, email and password.
    - The username of a user cannot belong to another active user.
    - The username of a user must not start with a number.
    - The username of a user can be, at most, 30 characters, and it can contain unicode characters.
    - The email of a user can be, at most, 100 characters, and it must not contain unicode characters.
    - The email of a user needs to be valid. An email will be sent to their address to enable their created accounts.
    - The email of a user cannot belong to another active user.
    - The password of a user can be, at most, 30 characters, and it can contain unicode characters. **Do Not** add any of the following special characters: "<", ">", "&". They will be sanitized and transformed to HTML entities. Example; "&" => &amp;. If you do so, your password will be different as the one you set in a beginning.
    - The inclusion of a custom profile picture is optional. A User will have a blank picture like any other social media apps (facebook, etc.) by default.
    - In case there is the inclusion of a custom profile picture: The allowed formats are: "jpeg", "jpg", "webp", "gif" or "png", and it must be a square (same width as height).

- **Posts**:
    - All posts require a header and a description.
    - The header of a post can be, at most, 100 characters, and it can contain unicode characters.
    - The description of a post can be, at most, 1000 characters, and it can contain unicode characters.
    - The inclusion of image(s) is optional. A post can have no images.
    - In case there is the inclusion of image(s): The allowed formats are: "jpeg", "jpg", "webp", "gif" or "png". No more than 3 images can be uploaded by post.

- **Comments**:
    - All comments require a description.
    - The description of a comment can be, at most, 300 characters, and it can contain unicode characters.
    - The inclusion of image(s) is optional. A comment can have no images.
    - In case there is the inclusion of image(s): The allowed formats are: "jpeg", "jpg", "webp", "gif" or "png". No more than 3 images can be uploaded by comment.


## Tools Used:
This API was developed mainly in **Plain/Vanilla PHP**. It uses the following libraries: <br>
1. **PHPMailer**
    - Used to send emails to users such as account verification emails, etc.

## Documentation
You have access to many endpoints. In the following document, we will show the endpoints available in the API, as well as their requirements and expected responses; They will be split into 2 categories:
1. **Authenticated Users**
    - Requests that can be made with no Authorization Headers sent.
2. **Unauthenticated Users**
    - Requests that can only be made with Authorization Headers sent.<br>

At the same time, the endpoints will be separated by entity in the database to facilitate an object-oriented comprehension.

## Unauthenticated Users
### <ins>Users</ins>
#### 1. Create User Profile
It allows you to create a user profile. The requirements vary whether you upload or not a custom profile picture.<br>

**POST Request to endpoint:**<br>
/users/signup

- **Profile with no custom profile picture requirements**:
    - Build a JSON body with the mandatory data for a user: username, email, password.
    - Send the JSON body directly as a JSON object to the endpoint. <br>

**Example :**
```
{
    "username": "test1",
    "email": "test1@example.ca",
    "password": "test1pass"
}
```
- **Profile with custom profile picture requirements**:
    - Build a form-data object.
    - Append a JSON body to the form-data object with the mandatory data for a user: username, email, password.<br>
    *[The appended JSON body **must** be named "jsonBody"]*
    - Append the corresponding image to the form-data object. <br>
    *[The appended image **must** be named "picture"]*
    - Send the form-data object to the endpoint.

**Expected response:**<br>
If everything went well, the API should send back the basic information of the created user and a message like the following example, and a **201** status code. Now, they should receive an email with the instructions to verify their account.
```
[Content-Type: "application/json"]
{
    "user": {
        "userId": 17,
        "username": "test1",
        "email": "test1@example.ca",

        "amountOfPosts": 0,
        "hierarchyLevelId": 2
    },
    "message": [
        "Account created. Please, check your inbox to verify your email address te***@example.ca"
    ]
}
```
**Expected exception response 1:**<br>
If any of the fields of the given data is invalid, the API should send back a JSON body with the information of the error and a **400** status code.
```
[Content-Type: "application/json"]
{
    "errors": ["error1", "error2", "error3"]
}
```

**Expected exception response 2:**<br>
If something went wrong while sending the verification email, the API should send back a JSON body with a generic internal server error message and a **500** status code.
```
[Content-Type: "application/json"]
{
    "errors": ["Error while creating account. Please try again or come back later."]
}
```

**Note:**  
*[You can send a form-data object in both scenarios. However, the appended JSON object **must** be named "jsonBody"]*

#### 2. Log In with user profile

#### 3. Verify email address (unusable)
It allows you to activate a recently created user account by verifying their email address. While it can technically be used,  the Original link sent in the verification email by the API takes well care of it. The requirements don't vary.<br>

**POST Request to endpoint:**<br>
/verifications/emails

- **Requirements**:

[Content-Type: "application/json"]
[path: "/comments/fakeid/replies"]
{
    "errors": ["Comment with id fakeid was not found"]
}
```

**Expected exception response 2:**<br>
If no comment Reaction of the logged-in user to the comment exists, the API should send back a JSON body with the information of the error and a **404** status code.
```
[Content-Type: "application/json"]
[path: "/comments/666/my/reactions"]
{
    "errors": ["Comment reaction with user Id 18 and comment Id 666 was not found"]
}
```

**Note:**  
*[You can send an object (JSON or form-data). However, it will not be taken into account because it is not useful in this request]*

**Expected Response**:<br>
If anything goes wrong with a request made by the user, the response will always return a JSON object similar to the following along with the corresponding status code of the error.
```
[Content-Type: "application/json"]
{
    "errors": [
        "error1"
    ]
}
```

**Note:**<br>
*[this way of handling exceptions facilitates the consumption of the API from client apps]*


## Implementation
If you would like to see an example of the consumption of this API. Feel free to visit this [repository](https://github.com/Sly-Perez/React-forum-client-JWT) in which you will find a sample of the functionalities this API can give you.
